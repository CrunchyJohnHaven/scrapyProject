# scrapyProject
Scraper collaboration

Day 1 - John Bradley
- Currently this scrapy project just has a tester reddit crawler in it. Scrapy research so far: 
scrapy shell dowloaded at - https://scrapy.org/ 

Ideas: Scrape high-end clothing companies for images and products.
- The user scrolls through pictures of models wearing the clothes, and when they click on the shirt or pant (with price next to it) the page takes them to the url where they can buy it. 

Ideas: Scrape twitter for #concert #event (x), and then scrape yelp and concert sites for the associated event. 
Render the events on a map, and correlate it with a users location.
